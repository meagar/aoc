For me, the fun part of this contest is writing short, messy, *lazy* solutions. Producing an answer with as little efort as possible.

The first few days are missing because I solved them entirely in `irb` (Ruby's REPL) and didn't bother writing any code to disk.

My general strategy is to copy the input file directly into my editor, and doctor the *hell* out of it until it's a Ruby data-structure that I can just *use*. This is one part of what I find fun about this: Using Vim macros to turn a large blob of text directly into executable code. For example, my Day 14 soltuion has my input file in comments at the top, and then the usable data structure below it.

Day 7 is another good example of spending about 2 minutes in Vim to turn a large gross file into a simple data structure. This is *so much faster* than programatically iterating over each line and extracting data with a regex.
